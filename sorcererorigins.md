# Elemental Sorcerer Origins

## Winter's Grasp
Lore Summary: Tends to be tied to fey or elemental spirits.  Perfect for a follower of Elemental Evil, or the Winter Court.
Level 1 - Snow Speaker - The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental cold.  You can speak, read, and write Primordial.
Level 1 - Winter's Grasp - You can use a bonus action to create an area of freezing cold, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher.  This area has a radius of 10 feet, and creatures that start their turn in the area or enter the area on their turn are slowed.  This area lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
Level 6 - Heart of Winter - You gain resistance to cold damage.  Whenever you cast a spell other than a cantrip that deals cold damage, a blast of winter chill surrounds you.  In addition to the spell's effects, creatures of your choice within 10 feet of the spell's target are slowed until the end of their next turn.
Level 6 - Frost Guide - As "Storm Guide" ability, with the added ability to control snow as well as rain.  Also gains Icewalk.
Level 14 - Fury of Frost - When you are hit by a melee attack, you can use a reaction to encase yourself in ice.  You gain resistance to the attack, and the attacker must make a Strength saving throw equal to 8 + Charisma + Prof.  On a failed save, they are incapacitated until the beginning of your next turn.
Level 18 - Soul of Winter - You gain immunity to cold damage.  In addition, you gain a +3 bonus to AC and resistance against non-magical weapons due to a layer of ice that you can have cover your body (which lasts until dismissed and takes a bonus action to create).   As an action, you can reduce your bonus to AC from this ability to +1, and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to 3 + your charisma modifier.  The chosen creatures get a +1 bonus to AC for 1 hour, and resistance against non-magical weapons. 
	
## Earthen Heart
Level 1 - Fire Tongue - The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental earth and fire.  You can speak, read, and write primordial.
Level 1 - Magma Armor - You can use a bonus action to create armor of earth and fire around you, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher.  This armor gives targets disadvantage to attack you, and they take 1d10 + your sorcerer level damage if they are able to successfully hit you in melee.  This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
Level 6 - Burning Spirit - You gain resistance to fire damage.  Whenever you cast a spell other than a cantrip that deals fire damage, you are able to imbue it shards of obsidian stone; the spell does additional slashing, bludgeoning, or piercing (your choice) damage equal to half your sorcerer level.
Level 6 - Touch of Earth and Fire - You can extinguish non-magical flames, and set fire to unattended objects, both as a bonus action.  In addition, you are able to determine if a geological area is stable or unstable, and are able to (through 1 minute of concentration) determine if there is any danger of an eruption or earthquake.  By spending 10 minutes in concentration, you can prevent such an event from occurring for 1 week.  Lastly, you can make harmless tremors occur around you.
Level 14 - Mastery of Tremors -  You gain blind sense 30 feet, and are able to, as an action, expend a spell slot and strike the ground.  When you do so, you create a shockwave that is either a 30 foot circle centered on you, or a 30 foot cone.  Creatures in the shockwave take 1d8 damage per spell level sacrificed, and fall prone.  They may make a DC equal to your Sorcerer Spell DC for half damage and to not fall prone.
Level 18 -  One with Earth and Flame - You gain immunity to fire damage.  In addition, you gain the ability to shape earth to create tunnels through earth and stone as part of your movement.  These tunnels last for 1 minute after you create them, and fill in without causing disruption to the terrain around them.  Further, you and any allies within 30 feet of you are unable to be knocked prone.
