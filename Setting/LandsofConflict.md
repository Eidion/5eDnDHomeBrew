# The Forge Master

**Domains**: Forge, Grave

The dwarves believe they were created by a Forge Master who resides under ground, as one of his greatest works.  They emulate him by crafting works of art.  The Forge Master also seeks to reforge what is lost or ruined; reforging dwarves in to new dwarves when they die.  Proper burial rights are key as a result.
